# Potentially-Useful-Code
No need to reinvent the wheel.
Code that may be useful in the future. This includes a lot of homework problems from Intro To Java Programming 11th Edition. 
All code is my (Zachary Farr) assignments from previous classes and problems. 
This contains every code I have written in VMI's CIS 111, 112, 211, 301, 302, 303, 313, and 442.
